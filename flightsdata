# Flight Delay Analysis

This project analyzes flight delay data to identify key factors contributing to delays, visualize trends, and generate insights for improving airline performance.

## Files in this Repository

- **DelayedFlights.ipynb** — Jupyter Notebook containing the full exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt** — List of Python libraries required to run the notebook.

## Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on flight delay data.
- Identify major causes of flight delays.
- Visualize delay patterns based on airlines, airports, and time periods.
- Suggest potential data-driven strategies to minimize delays.

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)
- Scikit-learn (if modeling is included)

## Key Insights

- Distribution of delays across airlines and airports.
- Correlation between delay duration and weather conditions.
- Seasonal patterns influencing flight punctuality.
